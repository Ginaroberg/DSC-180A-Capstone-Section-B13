# DSC-180A Capstone Project - Section B13

### Project Overview
*(Under construction)*

**Important Note:** Access to NCAR is required to run code.

### Data
Due to missing experiments and variables on NCAR, we cannot fully replicate the cleaned datasets provided by the [ClimateBench repository](https://github.com/duncanwp/ClimateBench/tree/v1.0.0). For convenience, processed data used for model training can be accessed through the Zenodo link available in the ClimateBench repository.

### Notebooks
Notebooks in this project are located in the `notebooks` folder. This includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** notebooks for data exploration.
- Notebooks with code in progress and not yet finalized to be put in `.py` script.


### src
The `src` folder contains all finalized code required to reproduce the results of this project. Key components include:

- **Data Processing Scripts**: Code for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation necessary for model input.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Scripts to train, validate, and evaluate models using the processed data.
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable helper functions for tasks such as data loading, metric calculations, and model setup.

Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and configured before running these scripts. Instructions for executing the code in this folder can be found in the **Usage** section below.
