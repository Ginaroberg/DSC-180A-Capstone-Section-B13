# DSC-180A Capstone Project - Section B13


### Important Note
**NCAR access is required to execute certain parts of the code, specifically for data retrieval, processing and EDA.**


*(This README is currently under construction)*

---


### Project Overview
*(Additional project details will be provided here)*


---


### Data
Due to certain experiments and variables missing on NCAR, we are unable to fully replicate the cleaned datasets from the [ClimateBench repository (v1.0.0)](https://github.com/duncanwp/ClimateBench/tree/v1.0.0). However, pre-processed data used for model training is available via the Zenodo link provided in the ClimateBench repository.


---


### Notebooks
The `notebooks` folder contains all project notebooks, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** notebooks, used for data exploration and visualization.
- **In-progress Code Notebooks**: Notebooks with code that is still being refined or tested before inclusion in the final `.py` scripts.

These notebooks offer insights into preliminary analysis and ongoing development stages.


---



### src
The `src` folder houses finalized code required to reproduce the projectâ€™s results. Key components include:

- **Data Processing Scripts**: Scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation to structure data for model input.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Scripts for training, validating, and evaluating models on the processed data.
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable helper functions for tasks like data loading, metric calculations, and model setup, which streamline the overall workflow.

Please ensure all required dependencies are installed and configured prior to running these scripts. Further instructions for running the code in this folder are detailed in the **Usage** section.
